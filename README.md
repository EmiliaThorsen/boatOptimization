# ornithe boat merger mod

this is a super simple mod that optimizes boats by merging continuous runs of boats in the ticking order to reduce entity calculations

the mod should be 100% vanilla accurate and is primarily made as a proof of concept for use with entity collision canons

if you find something inconsistent with vanilla make an issue plz
